# How to Download the gerber File from GitHub and Upload it to Lion Circuits for PCB Manufacturing
If you’ve stored your Gerber file in a GitHub repository and need to use it for PCB manufacturing, here’s a simple guide to help you download it and upload it to Lion Circuits.



## 1. Downloading the Gerber File from GitHub
Navigate to Your GitHub Repository:

### Open your web browser and go to the GitHub repository where your project is hosted.
Locate the gerber File:

### Inside your repository, look for the gerber file. This file contains the necessary data for PCB fabrication.
Download the File:

### Click on the gerber folder or file to open it.
If it’s a folder containing multiple files, you’ll see a "Download ZIP" button on the right-hand side. Click it to download the entire folder as a ZIP file.
If the gerber file is a ZIP file or just a single file:

### Click on the file to view its content.
If it’s not already a ZIP, click on the “Download” button or link to save the file directly to your computer.

### Extract the ZIP File (if applicable):

If the downloaded gerber file is a ZIP file, extract it on your local machine to access the individual Gerber files.



## 2. Uploading the Gerber File to Lion Circuits
Visit Lion Circuits Website:

   https://www.lioncircuits.com/

Go to Lion Circuits and log into your account, or create one if you haven’t already.
### Start a New PCB Order:

Look for the option to start a new PCB order on your dashboard.
### Upload the gerber ZIP File:

Click the "Upload Gerber Files" button and select the gerber ZIP file (or the extracted files) from your computer. Lion Circuits will automatically process the files and prepare them for manufacturing.
### Review Your PCB Design:

After uploading, Lion Circuits will provide a preview of your PCB. Carefully check the preview to ensure everything is correct.
### Configure PCB Specifications:

Customize your PCB according to your needs by selecting options like board thickness, solder mask color, and surface finish.
### Place the Order:

Once everything is set, proceed to place your order. Lion Circuits will handle the manufacturing and ship the completed PCB to your address.


## 3. Track Your Order
After placing the order, you can track its progress directly on the Lion Circuits platform.
Once the manufacturing is complete, your PCB will be shipped to you, ready for use in your project.
